Setting up and Running an Epics Input/Output Controller
=========================================================


Running the Epics IOC
----------------------

The above installation will build all the epics modules, including the
Xspress 3 application in the current folder. It will also create a
'bin' directory in your /home/xspress3/epics' folder that contains
scripts to set your environment and run the Xspress 3 IOC

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File
     - Description
   * - bin/bash_profile.sh 
     - bash script to set environmental variables
   * - bin/procServ
     - useful utility for long-running tasks like an IOC
   * - bin/medm
     - simple, minimal Epics display manager
   * - bin/run_xspress3.sh
     - bash script to run an XSPRESS 3 IOC
   * - bin/start_ioc
     - python script to run the Xspress3 using procServ
   * - bin/run_xrfcontrol.py
     - python script to view and control the Xspress 3
   * - bin/run_medm.sh 
     - bash script to launch medm for your Xspress 3

After building you can configure an Xspress 3 IOC, starting with one of
the defaults in the ioc directory:

.. code:: bash

    /home/xspress3/epics/xspress3/iocs/xspress3IOC/iocBoot

.. note::

	If you change the prefix or the number of detector elements used, you may need to edit several of the files in the bin/ directory to match your :ref:`configuration <Configuring your IOC>`.



Once properly configured, you should be able to run your xspress 3 in a
long-running procServ process with:

.. code:: bash

    /home/xspress3/epics/bin/start_ioc xspress3

and then view screens for your detector either using an Epics display
manager like medm, caqtdm, or css/boy.  Display screens for these
display managers can be found in the folders:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File
     - Description
   * - /home/xspress3/epics/adls 
     - screen files for medm
   * - /home/xspress3/epics/uis
     - screen files for caqtm
   * - /home/xspress3/epics/opis
     - screen files for css/boy


For example, you will be able to run MEDM for your Xspress 3 with:

.. code:: bash

    /home/xspress3/epics/bin/run_medm.sh

You will also be able to run a dedicated XRF Control application with:

.. code:: bash

    /home/xspress3/epics/bin/run_xrfcontrol.py
